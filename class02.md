# class01 Reading Notes:

![Packages](https://simplesnippets.tech/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/packages-in-java-programming-featured-image-1280x720.jpg)

* Package = directory. Java classes can be grouped together in packages.

* import statements:allow you to specify classes from other packages that can be referenced without qualifying them with their package.

### Imports: three options:

1. The wildcard character (*) is used to specify that all classes with that package are available to your program.
2. Make a single class visible.(by using ".")
3. qualified class name without an import.

##### Static imports in Java 5:
* Java 5 added an import static option that allows static variables (typically constants) to be referenced without qualifying them with a class name


## types of Loops in Java:

* Looping: is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions until the controlling Boolean-expression evaluates to false.

1. For Loop:Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code a known number of times

2. While Loop:  while loop is that it will repeat a set of instructions based on a condition.

3. Do-While Loop: like while loop except the first iteration.
