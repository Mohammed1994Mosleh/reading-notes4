## Don't repeat yourself:

DRY principle: Don't repeat yourself.
![DRY principle](https://miro.medium.com/max/686/1*rAqvkElSismRQsJvEeuh0g.png).

* DRY stand for "Don't Repeat Yourself" a basic principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of information. The DRY principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge or logic must have a single, unambiguous representation within a system".

* How to Achieve DRY:
To avoid violating the DRY principle, divide your system into pieces.

* Alternatives:
1. WET:
WET solutions are common in multi-tiered architectures where a developer may be tasked with, for example, adding a comment field on a form in a web application.

2. AHA:
AHA stands for "Avoid Hasty Abstractions".

## Rule of three:
Rule of three stands for "Three strikes and you refactor".

It  when similar code is repeat three times, code should be changed to new one.

## You aren't gonna need it:
stands for Always implement things when you actually need them never when you just foresee that you need them.

## Minimum viable product(MVP):
![Minimum viable product](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e8/27/c5/e827c53f9624b32c5c19c774fc522890.jpg)

developers potentially avoid lengthy and (ultimately) unnecessary work. Instead, they iterate on working versions and respond to feedback, challenging and validating assumptions about a product's requirements.

* This strategy targets avoiding building products that customers do not want and seek to maximize information about the customer with the least money spent
 
 ### Purposes: 
 1. Ability to test a product hypothesis with minimal resources.
 2. Accelerate learning.
 3. Reduce wasted engineering hours.
 4. Get the product to early customers as soon as possible.
 5. Base for other products
 6. To establish a builder's abilities in crafting the product required.
 7. Brand building very quickly.

 ### Emerging applications:
 Aspects of MVP:
 - Minimum viable brand (MVB):
 ensure brand hypotheses are grounded in strategic intent and market insights.

 - Minimum viable co-founder:
 looking for a co-founder with these attributes(Trust,Exceptional at building or selling,Company commitment,Productivity,Rational,Realistic).

 - Minimum viable team: 

 * Criticism:
