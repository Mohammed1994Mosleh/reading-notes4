* Their is many examples of Object in world (Bicycles,Lion) also it hasits own states and behavior.

* Software objects likes areal object it has states (variables in programming languages) and behavior (Methods) ;

* data encapsulation:
Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods .

### oop provides these benifites:

1. Modularity.
2. Information-hiding.
3. Code re-use.
4. Pluggability and debugging ease
## Class:
A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.

#### Inheritance:

Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.

#### Interface:
Interfaces allow you to specify what methods a class should implement.

####  Package:

Package just organize the related classes and its related iterfaces in one file called package.
